* Run replicates of subsampled analysis to check consistency
* Run known-category indexical group inference
* Classify bilinguals vs. non-bilinguals.
* Classify talkers
* Which categories are _most_ informative about indexical groups?
    * How to quantify this? Entropy of group given token?
* Bootstrap/permutation tests for KL divergence
    * Effect of group size vs. actual grouping.
    * Better measure of uncertainty in KL (talker is the relvant grouping for that, not groups themselves).
